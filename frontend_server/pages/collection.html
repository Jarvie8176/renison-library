            <p>Each book in the collection is marked with a colored dot to indicate the cultural group:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><span style="color:#ffa319">Yellow</span> for Korean</p></li>
                    <li><p><span style="color:#ff0000">Red</span> for Chinese</p></li>
                    <li><p><span style="color:#336633">Green</span> for Japanese</p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The books are shelved together in their respective cultural groups. </p>
            <p>Every book is organized by <a href="http://www.library.illinois.edu/ugl/about/dewey.html">Dewey decimal number</a> within its cultural group. Because of the limitations of the original Dewey decimal system, we use a modified version that was developed in-house to meet the needs of the East Asian collection.</p>

            <p>Following the Dewey number, a three-character Cutter code indicates the authorâ€™s surname.</p>
            <p>Finally, each book is affixed with a barcode that serves as a unique identifier and makes possible automated scanning.</p>
