            <p>Prior to the completion of the EASC project in August 2015, circulation was conducted manually through borrowing cards.</p>
            <p>Currently, all books have a corresponding digital record that is collected within a <a href="http://www.readerware.com/index.php">Readerware database</a>. Each item’s digital record is identified by a unique barcode number (“Call Number" in Readerware).</p>
            <p>The searching, loaning, and returning of items is done through the Readerware software. Patrons may conduct a search of the Readerware database through this online portal, or at a self-serve terminal within the Lusi Wong library.</p>
